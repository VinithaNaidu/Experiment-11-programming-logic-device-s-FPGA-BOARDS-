 ### AIM: To understand the standard procedure to interface an FPGA board and flashing method using usb blaster 
### HARDWARE REQUIRED:  â€“ PC, Cyclone II , USB flasher
### SOFTWARE REQUIRED:   Quartus prime
### THEORY 

### Procedure 
Start the Quartus II Programmer.
Click Add File and select the path to the desired .sof.
Turn on the Program/Configure option for the added file.
Click Start to download the selected file to the FPGA. Configuration is complete when the progress bar reaches 100%.
